# VBA-challenge
This is my homework

I have managed to run the code through one year and generate information on yearly change, percent change and total volume of each ticker.
I have also applied color coding for yearly change and modified the number of decimals for percent change.
Unfortunately I did not manage to run the code successfully through different sheets in the workbook and I would appreciate feedback on how to approach this.
